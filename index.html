        <h2>Tips:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Perform relaxing activities:</strong> Breathing exercises,
          meditation, wellness apps, and journaling can help reduce stress and
          improve overall health and well-being.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Practice gratefulness:</strong> People can practice
          <em>mindfulness</em> and <em>gratitude</em> by actively identifying
          things they are grateful for daily.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Challenge negative thoughts:</strong> A person can practice
          positivity by becoming aware of their negative and unhelpful thoughts
          and challenging them.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Look for positive social interactions:</strong> Connecting and
          maintaining meaningful connections and relationships reduces stress
          and can also be a source of support and practical help in times of
          need.
